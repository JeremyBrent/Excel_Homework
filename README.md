What is it?
  - I used Excel functions, pivot tables, and charting to visualize and understand the market for Kickstarter crowdfunded fundraisers. 
 
Excel Homework 

1.	Three conclusions:
-	More Kickstarter campaigns are successful than not (2,185 successful campaigns out of 4,114 campaigns, or 53% of all Kickstarter campaigns were successful). 
-	Theatre (1,393 campaigns), music (700 campaigns), technology (600 campaigns), and film & video (520 campaigns) categories had the most Kickstarter campaigns (Combined 3,213 campaigns out of 4,114 camapigns, or 78%).
-	Plays, as a sub-category, had both the most successful (694 campaigns) and most failed fundraising campaigns (353 campaigns). 

2.	 Potential Limitations
-	We could potentially compile data from other crowdsourcing websites, like GoFundMe, IndieGoGo, Crowdfunder, etc., to build a more general understanding of crowdsourcing market behaviors. 
-	Campaigns in different countries use different currencies. I am not sure if the values have been converted to USD. If they have been converted then this is not a limitation. However, if they are not converted and are simply numerical elements then our data misrepresents analyses which use the goal or the pledged columns. For example, the worth of the USD is not the same as the worth of the AUD. If we are comparing states of campaigns based on the goals of each campaign using different currencies, like we did in the bonus, then our analyses will incorporate confounding factors that we have no accounted for (the exchange rate) which will influence the interpretation of the data. 
-	In the background section of the instructions, it states that there have been “300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter.” However, we are only analyzing 4,114 projects. That means that we are analyzing a sample of the total Kickstarter campaigns. If the sample is not representative of the total population of Kickstarter campaigns then our statistics and analyses will not be generalizable. 

3.	Other tables/graphs we could use.
-	We could look at what the average contribution was based on the category or sub category and determine which category/sub-category tends to obtain larger contributions. 
-	We could look at percent funded by category/sub-category. While this analysis would be similar to the campaign’s state by category/sub-category, the research would provide a more detailed/specific picture of the campaign’s states.
-	We could look at backers based on category/sub-category.
-	We could look at backers based on the start or end date to try and visualize a potential relationship in seasonal variation.
-	We could look at average contribution by start or end date and again, try and parse out a potential relationship of seasonal variation on how much people are willing to give. 
There would be potential limitations with the last two suggestions because we do not have specific dates of each contribution to a campaign so we would be, in my opinion, grossly over-generalizing a relationship if there so-happened to be one. 
-	We could look at State by Country to see if there is a relationship between the two variables. 

Bonus Statistical Analysis 
1.	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.
-	In both cases, the median is significantly smaller than the average. This tells me that there are highly influential outliers towards the larger end of the range; A few campaigns have significantly more backers then the majority of the campaigns which moves our average higher than the median. Based on our statistical knowledge, we know the average is vulnerable to magnitude of an outlier. Therefore, I will say that the median is more representative of the data, as a whole, as it is robust to the influence of the significant outliers. 
2.	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
-	Successful campaigns have more variability in their number of backers compared to failed campaigns. This makes sense because failed campaigns have a discrete threshold that qualifies them as failed campaigns. That is, a failed campaign will always have money raised in a range between $0.00 and its goal. On the other hand, a successful campaign will have a range that qualifies it as successful between the campaigns goal and infinity; There is no limit to how much money a successful campaign can generate. Because our summary statistics tell us that their average number of backers for a successful campaign is higher than that of an unsuccessful campaign, we can conclude that there is an association between number of backers and the state of the campaign. Therefore, because the range that qualifies an unsuccessful campaign is limited, there is less room for variance.
